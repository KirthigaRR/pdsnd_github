# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
## Udacity - Programming for  Data science with python - Project II

#### Overview of the project
In this project I have used the data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, 
to uncover bike share usage patterns.The code is written in a way to compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

The code is written in python to import the data and answers the data related questions by computing descriptive statistics. 
It is also written in the way to get the raw input from the user to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project,the following softwares are required:

- Python
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application

### The Datasets
The datasets contain randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files have these two additional columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

### Statistics Computed:

#### 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

#### 2. Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#### 3. Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

#### 4. User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- The number of missing values
- The particular user trip data can also be explored.
